					<h2>The birth of SNHS</h2>
					<p>Destiny takes its own course for Sorsogon National High School. Its first mark in history commenced upon its establishment on June 24, 1903 with an initial enrolment of 84 students handled by two American Teachers under the supervision of Mr. Stephen W. Ford as its first principal.
                        <br><br>
                        Tracing back from available facts, Sorsogon High School (now Sorsogon National High School) began during the American Regime which aimed at providing instruction for “self-government”. It traces its growth from fledgling unit to its full status today. Since then, the school has continued to discharge its duties.
                        <br><br>
                        The first teaching unit was an imposing and spacious two-storey building originally located at the present site of the SNHS main building. It was semi-concrete, lumber being a big part of the material used, gathered through voluntary contributions from civic spirited people of the province. This was through the leadership of the Provincial Governor Dr. Bernardino Monreal. The flooring of the first and second floors was of first class wood. The building housed the first intermediate classes in the entire province. There was a grandstand in the athletic ground. The first teachers were mostly Americans and the medium of instruction was English. Later, the First Filipino teachers trained by the Thomasites started teaching in 1908.
                        Finally, the second bearing the name Sorsogon National High School was opened for secondary education before the second decade of the American Regime ended. Most of the teachers were not properly trained for teaching. Textbooks were scarce, hence instruction was poor. These experiences provided school authorities the stimulus to formulate educational policies for the establishment of a new school system. In its first academic year, SHS had a faculty composed of Americans and an enrolment of a handful of students. The students paid P18.00 annually for tuition fees payable in three installments. The boys wore long-sleeved shirts and khaki pants while the girls had white blouses and blue skirts. Pre-war graduates recalled with nostalgia the strict observance of the wearing of coat and tie among its faculty members. In 1921, the school held its first graduation exercises. There were five students in the course of their study would be under all teachers. Consequently both students and teachers knew each other well.
                        <br><br>
                        The years 1930 to 1940 witnessed the achievements of the school. This was the pre-war Sorsogon High School, which was truly the pride of the province. Beyond its physical grandeur, it’s excelled in the fields of academics, athletics and culture with the competent and dedicated faculty members.</p>

					<h2>The second decade of the American Regime</h2>

                        The years 1930 to 1940 witnessed the achievements of the school. This was the pre-war Sorsogon High School, which was truly the pride of the province. Beyond its physical grandeur, it’s excelled in the fields of academics, athletics and culture with the competent and dedicated faculty members.
                        <br><br>
                        In the 1940-1941, the school introduced the so called double session wherein a teacher has to handle one class in the morning and another in the afternoon. The war, however, brought the enforced educational blackout from 1941-1944. On November 15, 1941, a month before the outbreak of the Second World War, the school building and the Saint Cecilia dormitory for girls were burned. Immediately after the war when classes reopened huts and shacks were used as temporary classrooms. Enrollment swelled as throughout the province flocked to enroll. Extension classes were opened. The construction of the building took some time.
                        <br><br>
                        The 50's saw some marked changes. Foremost among these was the completion of the reconstruction of the SHS. This was through the joint efforts of the late Congressman Teodoro de Vera and the provincial board. The spacious library, biology, physics room, armory, retail store, home economics, canteen, and the office of the principal and personnel were located. The reconstructed building was named Sorsogon Provincial High School. The spacious main building has its second floor the famous and well-loved social hall and grand stage, which due to influx of students resulting from the enforcement of the free-secondary education had to be converted into small classrooms.

					<h2>Creative CREATIONS</h2>
					<p>Earlier, The Luzon Tip, the school's publication, was officially organized. Columbus Maquito was one of its pioneering editors, and Miss Hortencia Benoza was the adviser. In 1954, the school principal, Mr. Emiliano Vida, replaced Mr. Angel lnstrella. During this time, Congressman Vicente Peralta worked for the release of the P10,000.00 for the construction of the cemented fence. In 1959, the new curriculum, the 2-2 plan was implemented wherein the third year students were divided into two groups, The College preparatory and the vocationally inclined. Electricity, Woodworking, Horticulture, Retail Merchandizing, Advanced Foods, and Dressmaking were the course offered.
                    <br><br>
                    Meanwhile, Mr. Isaias Leocadio assumed office as principal from 1962-1965. During his term, the cemented base of the school's flagpole was constructed. With his untimely death in 1965, Mrs. Priscilla Sabado took over as principal. Mrs. Sabado was credited for such project as the nationalization of the school, the construction of a pilot bakery, the multi-purpose greenhouse, and the acquisition of the athletic grounds. At this time the revised secondary school curriculum replaced the 2-2 plan. It was in 1965 that the school was named Sorsogon National High School.
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes in 1969, Mrs. Sabado pioneered the opening of the evening class secondary education. This system took a regular class student five years to graduate. In 1973, the high school evening class had its first graduation.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1978, the Community College of Midwifery was established between 1972-1973, Mrs. Sabado and Mr. Pedro Sta. Ana, PTA president, joined hands to present a resolution to nationalize the school. Congressman Rafael Aquino proposed the resolution to the House of Congress through the House Bill No. 4712 on September 1972. The budget for the nationalization of the SPHS was approved in the year 1975 thus tuition fees were standardized at P92.00 annually for all year levels. It was also during this time when three American Peace Corps volunteers joined the faculty. Brian Furby taught Science; Tom Mathis, Mathematics; Frank Kalistak, Creative writing.
                    <br><br>
                    After almost 10 years as school administrators, Mrs. Saba do retired from service in 1976. Mrs. Nonita D. Julian succeeded her as principal. By this time the school had grown tremendously. Increased enrolment had exceeded the capacity of the two-storey building. The increase was due to the implementation of the free secondary education as mandated by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Mrs. Julian continued the task of building additional classrooms. Teachers and students' activism and drug addiction were slowly beginning to build up. The situation remained under control. Towards the end of Mrs. Julian's administration, SNHS was chosen the Regional leader school for Science and Mathematics.</p>

					<h2>TESTIMONIALS NOW</h2>
					<p>The 80's brought in outstanding students' outstanding accomplishments that seemingly repaired the sagging spirit of the school. In 1981, Cesar Balmaceda was able to go to Canada for leadership training under the exchange scholar program of the Education department. Meanwhile, Cherie Colon won first place in the internationally sponsored ASEAN essay writing contest. And in 1987, Eduardo N. Sipoy competed with foreign students in Puerto Rico during the International Science Fair. His low-cost projector won third place in the said fair.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1987-1988, Mrs. Luz G. Angeles, was appointed Officer-In-Charge of the school after the retirement of Mrs. Nonita D. Julian. The brief tenure of Mrs. Angeles was marred by Typhoon Sisang, which took a heavy toll on the entire school buildings. The main building was among those almost completely damaged. Amidst this ruins, classes resumed three weeks after the typhoon. To the credit of Mrs. Angeles, commencement exercises for the 1988 batch was held as scheduled.
                    <br><br>
                    In April 1988, Mrs. Rebecca B. Alarcon was appointed Principal III of SNHS. Perceived to be quite but generous and hardworking, her words spoke action. Upon assuming office, she moved swiftly for the repair of destroyed structures as well as the construction of new classrooms. All these projects were designed to accommodate increase in enrolment and to promote better access to education. During her term SNHS hosted three successful summer SEDP Training for Science and Mathematics. Ken McBride, an American Peace Corps was a visiting instructor in Science. A year after her assumption of office, Mrs. Alarcon was chosen "Most Outstanding Principal in the Division of Sorsogon." Again, the school's curriculum had undergone another innovation, from the 2-2 plan to the revised Secondary Education Curriculum (NSEC). The school also received seven million pesos aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that financed the general renovation of the second floor of the main building. Mrs. Alarcon retired from office on 1996.
                    Mrs. Lina Nieva S. Casals, ES I, was designated Officer-In-Charge of SNHS by the Regional Director of DECS in lieu of the retirement of Mrs. Rebecca B. Alarcon in 1996.
                    <br><br>
                    During her tenure as OIC she was able to minimize the problem of the school on students’ discipline. The school attained and achieved academic excellence, character transformation, social and physical well-being through her intensified classroom instruction program and her close supervision.</p>

Escudero III and the DPWH to realign the two room academic building for Guinlajon Extension to SNHS which is in need of additional classroom due to its big student population. She was also instrumental for the implementation of the decongestion of central school to the barangays by opening the third extension HS of SNHS in San Isidro Bacon.
                    <br><br>
                    In December 1996, Mrs. Casals went back to the Division Office as the appointed principal, Purita B. Jimenez, Ph.D., assumed office.
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Jimenez assumed office and was able to reclassify the Principal III position to Principal IV. Her stay in SNHS made a difference. The state of the art stage in the annex campus, the learning center and the Philippine 2000 building were among the additional structure in the campus. Adding the covered walk and pathways jointly constructed by the faculty and Personnel Association and the student council. She was known for her high expectation in terms of performance and competition. As principal IV, her administration was challenged with the revision of the NSEC curriculum to Basic Education Curriculum, this posted greater challenge in its implementation and supervision. The tremendous increase in enrolment during her term created variety of problems and dilemma in terms of students' behavior that she designated Mr. Joel Nato as prefect of discipline. Mr. Nato worked hand in hand with the Guidance Counselor for a closer supervision of students. It was at Mrs. Jimenez tenure that several teachers were designated officers-in-charge of the newly created schools. Also at this point, several teachers qualified to the DepEd-NEAP Scholarship Program. She was the first Principal IV of the Sorsogon City Division. After 11 years as Principal IV she retired at the age of 62 in 2007. Her Principal IV position was awarded to Dr. Blanca D. Rempillo, being rank one in the conducted Division ranking of secondary school heads.</p>
